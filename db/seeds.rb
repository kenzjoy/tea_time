  description: 'Yogi Ginger tea is purposefully blended with Ginger, a time-honored herb with a long history of use for supporting digestion. Herbalists throughout the world have known of the rejuvenating, soothing, and invigorating qualities of Ginger, and Ayurvedic practitioners have used it as a way of activating the bodyâ€™s internal energy to promote balance and harmony. Yogi Ginger tea builds on this tradition by adding a uniquely delicious blend of Lemongrass, Licorice, Peppermint, and Black Pepper for a warming and spicy tea enjoyable any time of day.',
